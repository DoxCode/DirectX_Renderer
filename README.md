# DirectX Renderer

## Introduction

DirectX Renderer is a series of programs in .NET using SharpDX, wrapper of the DirectX API (native C++),
designed to help with functions like Overlay text non-hooked, quickly image capture and other hooked options.

## Overlay (Non-Hooked method)
Some times you might need a method to write over the screen without using hooks, for example to skip a VAC of a game, because hooks may become detectable in the future, so a solution is an external solution.

How works?
The overlay is a hidden transparent windows renderer on the top, allowing interact with other windows, this form is invisible, don't appear in Alt-tab window or taskbar. You can use a basic windows-form objects or draw direct using DirectX functions.

Tested on Windows 7 (64bits) / Windows 10 (64 bits)

## Screen Capture - Stream Screen
Can capture the screen using DirectX technology, this program can render ~70 photos per second (fps) with native quality.

Very useful for example to processing data stream in the screen, searching patterns, automation, pixelHacking etc... or for desktop recorder programs (I don't recommend this last, I'm sure exist better alternatives).

In this example the program update the image of a PictureBox to show the average fps and ms that took.
